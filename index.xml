      <description>After working on Spartan game engine for so long, it became increasingly obvious that there are many interesting things that I could be writing about. However, I kept postponing it as I was growing fond of Hugo and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to invest any content (or money) on WordPress anymore. The good thing is that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the courage to transition to this slick and fast site you&amp;rsquo;re browsing now!</description>
