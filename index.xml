      <description>Recently, I added HDR support to Spartan, expecting it to be a quick task. However, it turned into a full day&amp;rsquo;s work. The main issue? I could only find bits and pieces of code and no all-in-one blog posts. So, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to simplify things for you. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive straight in and aim to get HDR up and running in under 10 minutes.&#xA;Step 1 - Swapchain First stop, the swapchain.</description>

      <description>After working on Spartan game engine for so long, it became increasingly obvious that there are many interesting things that I could be writing about. However, I kept postponing it as I was growing fond of Hugo and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to invest any content (or money) on WordPress anymore. The good thing is that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the courage to transition to this slick and fast site you&amp;rsquo;re browsing now!</description>
