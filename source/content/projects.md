### 2016 - **Spartan Engine**

{{< youtube JSQ4gocCXeU >}}

I had to "finish" this project within a year so I could use it as a ticket ouf of Greece and into a well known studio/company.
To achieve this, I did 100+ work hour weeks, that's about 14 hours per day, every day.

As of today, it's one of the most complete, one-man, open-source game engines on GitHub.
For a detailed description, source code and binaries, click [here](https://github.com/PanosK92/SpartanEngine) to visit the GitHub page.

### 2015 – **Da Vinci’s Ornithopter**

{{< figure src="/media/projects_davincisornithopter.jpg" alt="image" caption="" class="center" >}}

An infinite runner with RPG elements, mini-games and some ok art.
It was basically a second take at Da Vinci's Flying Machine.
After 6 months of development, I realised that this idea needed a programmer, an artist, a designer and a sound engineer.
So the project was put on hold.

**Team:** Solo • **Platform:** PC • **Tools**: C#, Unity (with NGUI) • **Location:** Greece

### 2015 – **The Screen Space**

{{< figure src="/media/projects_screenspace.jpg" alt="image" caption="" class="center" >}}

A short game developed with [Kickback Studios](https://www.kickback-studios.com/) (creators of [Lost Echo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lost-echo/id693045097)) as a Ludum Dare [entry](https://kickback.itch.io/the-screen-space).
I implemented the player’s controls, a jetpack mechanic and a rope-bucket mechanic that acted as a grappling hook. All of these mechanics were physics based.

### 2014 – **Dementia** – Microsoft Imagine Cup World Finalist, Redmond, Washington, US

{{< figure src="/media/projects_dementia.jpg" alt="image" caption="" class="center" >}}

Dementia was a turn-based table game with RPG elements that we used as an entry for Imagine Cup, a world-wide competition that promotes student entrepreneurship.
I implemented the user interface, artificial intelligence, path-finding and did most of the gameplay programming among other things.
The development was a never-ending crunch, the atmosphere in the team was chaotic and despite all that, here we were, sleep deprived, wondering around Microsoft HQ in Redmond as world-wide finalists.
A unique experience that helped grow in more ways than I expected.

A spatial approach to audio mixing.
This was a free app geared towards building a Windows Store portfolio.

### 2012 - **Da Vinci’s Flying Machine**

{{< figure src="/media/projects_davincisflyingmachine.jpg" alt="image" caption="" class="center" >}}

An infinite runner inspired by the works of Leonardo da Vinci, developed as part of a Microsoft Hackathon which took place in Athens.
Despite being made in a few days, It won 4th place, best splash screen, and did well in the Windows Store as a paid game.
This little game bought me a gaming PC and was the first lesson on how to craft a product.

A collaboration between me, two fellow students and professor [Omiros Iatrellis](https://dblp.org/pers/i/Iatrellis:Omiros.html), on a project that enabled control of a PC using Kinect.
It was developed using the Kinect Beta SDK and it was one of the very first advanced Kinect applications at the time. 
The project was a success and attracted the attention of the local academic community and press.

### 2011 - **Lucky ball-aki**

{{< figure src="/media/projects_luckyballaki.png" alt="image" caption="" class="center" >}}

A magic 8-ball game with a name that only makes sense in Greek (ouch).

The prize was a windows phone, good times.

### 2009 - **Project Cocktail** :smile:

{{< figure src="/media/bartender.jpg" alt="image" caption="Me and El Duderino" class="center" >}}
{{< figure src="/media/cocktail.jpg" alt="image" caption="Not me" class="right" >}}
{{< figure src="/media/zakynthos.jpg" alt="image" caption="Zakynthos" class="left" >}}

As a high school student, I didn't have to do anything but after receiving my Certificate of Proficiency in English by the University of Michigan, I decided to get a job as a bartender/waiter.
Mainly to practice my english in real-life scenarios and have fun, but most of all because I've always believed that hard work builds character.
So chances are that if you visited Zakynthos, Greece during that period, I was the guy serving you your refreshing cold beverage :smile:
