### 2016 - **Spartan Engine**

{{< youtube JSQ4gocCXeU >}}

I had to "finish" this project within a year so I could use it as a ticket ouf of Greece and into a well known studio/company.
To achieve this, I did 100+ work hour weeks, that's about 14 hours per day, every day.

As of today, it's one of the most complete, one-man, open-source game engines on GitHub.

### 2015 – **Da Vinci’s Ornithopter**

![image](/media/projects_davincisornithopter.jpg)

An infinite runner with RPG elements, mini-games and some ok art.
It was basically a second take at Da Vinci's Flying Machine.
After 6 months of development, I realised that this idea needed a programmer, an artist, a designer and a sound engineer.
So the project was put on hold.

**Team:** Solo • **Platform:** PC • **Tools**: C#, Unity (with NGUI) • **Location:** Greece

### 2015 – **The Screen Space**

![image](/media/projects_screenspace.jpg)

A short game developed with [Kickback Studios](https://www.kickback-studios.com/) (creators of [Lost Echo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lost-echo/id693045097)) as a Ludum Dare [entry](https://kickback.itch.io/the-screen-space).
I implemented the player’s controls, a jetpack mechanic and a rope-bucket mechanic that acted as a grappling hook. All of these mechanics were physics based.

### 2014 – **Dementia** – Microsoft Imagine Cup World Finalist, Redmond, Washington, US

![image](/media/projects_dementia.jpg)

Dementia was a turn-based table game with RPG elements that we used as an entry for Imagine Cup, a world-wide competition that promotes student entrepreneurship.
I implemented the user interface, artificial intelligence, path-finding and did most of the gameplay programming among other things.
The development was a never-ending crunch, the atmosphere in the team was chaotic and despite all that, here we were, sleep deprived, wondering around Microsoft HQ in Redmond as world-wide finalists.
A unique experience that helped grow in more ways than I expected.

The dot in the circle is an audio listener, all the other dots are audio sources. 
The distance between the audio listener and an audio source is the volume. 
A spatial approach to audio mixing.
This was a free app geared towards building a Windows Store portfolio.

### 2012 - **Da Vinci’s Flying Machine**

![image](/media/projects_davincisflyingmachine.jpg)

An infinite runner inspired by the works of Leonardo da Vinci, developed as part of a Microsoft Hackathon which took place in Athens.
Despite being made in a few days, It won 4th place, best splash screen, and did well in the Windows Store as a paid game.
This little game bought me a gaming PC and was the first lesson on how to craft a product.

*Zakynthos*

As a high school student, I didn't have to do anything but after receiving my Certificate of Proficiency in English by the University of Michigan, I decided to get a job as a bartender/waiter.
Mainly to practice my English in real-life scenarios and have fun, but most of all because I've always believed that hard work builds character.
So chances are that if you visited Zakynthos, Greece during that period, I was the guy serving you your refreshing cold beverage :smile:

Achievement unlocked: Going low.
